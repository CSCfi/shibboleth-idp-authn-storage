# shibboleth-idp-storage-auth

## Overview
This project offers a possibility to store Shibboleth IdP v3 authentication flow result to storage to cache the result. The goal is to have more loose requirements for using second factor when user is revisiting the service with same browser. This mechanism is intended to be used only within MFA authentication and the provided flows do not work as standalone authentication flows. 

## Installation & Configuration
See wiki.
